8-bit computer

This is an attempt to mimic the 8-bit breadboard computer by Ben Eater: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU

This will implement everything in VHDL, taylored for the BASYS2 FPGA board http://store.digilentinc.com/basys-2-spartan-3e-fpga-trainer-board-limited-time-see-basys-3/.

The FPGA board is based on a Spartan-3E FPGA chip from Xilinx.

Suggestions and contributions are welcome.

Please see the [log file](https://github.com/MJoergen/bcomp/blob/master/log.md) for 
implementation details and links to individual videos.
